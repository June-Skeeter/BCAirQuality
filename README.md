# BC Air Qaulity Data for GEOS 270 Final Projects

This repository contains aggregate air quality data from DataBC.  

The **Data/** folder includes: "PM25", "O3", and "CO" which are harmful pollutants along with air temperature (TEMP).  The hourly data have been aggregated by year, by month from 2010 onwards, and daily from Jan 1st 2021 onwards for your convenience.  The datasets included all stations that have >50% data coverage. It's up to you to decide how to handle missing data beyond that.  If you need data for other polutnants, specific dates prior to 2021, or would like hourl data, don't hesitate to reach out!

The MonitoringStations.csv file contains information including the coordinates of each station.  The "EMS_ID" column is the index that matches the stations to the data.
