This repository contains:
1) A script that downloades and aggregates hourly air quality data from DataBC
2) The aggregated monthly and yearly datasets for 2009-2017
    - The columns denot the year or month
    - Not all years/months are availiable at all stations.  It's up to you to decide how to handle missing data
