This repository contains aggregate air quality data from DataBC.  

The Data/ folder includes: "PM25", "O3", and "CO" which are harmful pollutants along with air temperature (TEMP).  The hourly data have been aggregated by year and month from 2010 onwards, and daily from Jan 1st 2021 onwards.  The datasets included all stations that have >50% data coverage. It's up to you to decide how to handle missing data beyond that.

The MonitoringStations.csv file contains information including the coordinates of each station.  The "EMS_ID" column is the index that matches the stations to the data.
